### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Alexander
I'm a 2023 computer science graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University, passionate about exploring and learning new technologies.

ðŸš€ I love turning theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. One of my notable projects is the development of a fan-made RESTful API for Honkai Star Rail, where I showcased my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and app deployment using Vercel. Currently, I'm working on adding new features to enhance the API's functionality.

ðŸ”§ Beyond technical prowess, I bring competencies in problem-solving, attention to detail, effective communication, time management, and collaboration to every project.
